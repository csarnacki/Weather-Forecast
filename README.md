# Weather-Forecast

This is a Weather Forecasting program that utilizes APIs to get the current weather for a city and then it displays what the weather forecast
will be like over the next five days.

It also displays some icons so the user can see what type of weather it will be for that day. Examples being rain, cloudy, or sunny.

Finally, it does also show what the current humidity and wind speed is for the day. Ajax is used for fetching each API and 
Day JS is used to obtain the current date and time.
